## Description

This is a landing page to a step-by-step guide on how to install the open source Software-Defined Perimeter solution by Waverley Labs, Inc. The original repositories [here](https://github.com/WaverleyLabs) include 
- fork of the original fwknop solution by Michael Rash, serving as basis for the SDP Gateway and Client modules 
- the SDP Controller module by Waverley Labs
These include step-by-step instructions on what is required and how to install the SDP modules. This, along with the detailed explanation of fwknop and SPA [at cipherdyne.org](https://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/fwknop-tutorial.html), serves as an important introduction on Software-Defined Perimeter.

However, junior information security professionals and others interested in the solution may benefit from more detailed guides. Hence, an elaborated installation guide was designed as a Bachelor's thesis with a very small targeted audience in mind, namely Finnish-speakers.

This is an elaborated installation guide of an open source Software-Defined Perimeter solution in Finnish. Main goals of writing the guide were:
- raising awareness of SDP as an important information security solution
- for the author himself to become more skilled in the technology
- to help aspiring and junior cybersecurity professionals acquire new skills

## Disclaimer

Please note that 
- the majority of what follows is in the Finnish language. Of course translating is ever so easy, but still.
- The guide is not 100 % complete. Depending on your skill level, it may help you especially with the Controller and Gateway modules, but less so on the Client module. A work in progress this is.
- I have no personal affiliation to Waverley Labs, Inc. or any other contributors herein. This guide was created out of personal interest and to help aspiring SDP users to get the required Linux boxes up and running just a bit more quickly.
